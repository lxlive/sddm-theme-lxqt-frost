## sddm-theme-deepspace

It is based on the elarun theme, but really modivied!

Layout and lots more.

I made that theme for siduction: http://siduction.org

(irc: #siduction / #siduction-de on irc.oftc.net)

For example, no successfully logged in lastUser is displayed, because of security reasons.

There is no chance to activate/deactivate it via /etc/sddm.conf, i tested it and it dosen't work.

so you have to manually edit the Main.qml, because of a bug
found here: 

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1238889

So take a look to the Main.qml and read the comments!

### How to test

(as user) sddm-greeter --test-mode --theme ~/downloads/directory/`<theme>`/


### How to install

(as root) copy the `<theme>` to /usr/share/sddm/themes/

be shure that the directory 'new theme' is set to drwxr-xr-x

if not, run chmod 755 'new theme'!

Otherwise you have no luck to use it!
